# PWA Implementation Documentation

## Overview
WisdomSutra now includes comprehensive Progressive Web App (PWA) support, enabling the app to work offline, be installable on devices, and provide a native app-like experience on web platforms.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Web App Manifest (`web/manifest.json`)
- **Updated Branding**: Proper app name "WisdomSutra - Mystical Guidance" with short name "WisdomSutra"
- **Theme Colors**: Updated to match app's mystical indigo theme (#2B1B6B)
- **Better Description**: "An App which has all the answers of life. Mystical guidance through interactive pattern-based divination."
- **PWA Metadata**: Added scope, categories, language, and text direction
- **Icon Purposes**: Specified "any" and "maskable" purposes for proper display across devices

### 2. Service Worker (`web/flutter_service_worker.js`)
The service worker provides:
- **Offline Support**: Caches essential resources for offline access
- **Smart Caching Strategy**: Cache-first strategy with network fallback
- **Automatic Updates**: Cleans up old caches when new version is activated
- **Offline Fallback**: Custom offline page when network is unavailable
- **Background Sync Support**: Ready for future enhancements
- **Push Notifications**: Skeleton for future notification features

Cached Resources:
- App shell (index.html)
- Web manifest
- Icons (all sizes)
- Favicon
- Offline fallback page

### 3. Enhanced HTML (`web/index.html`)
- **PWA Meta Tags**: Added viewport, application-name, and theme-color
- **iOS Support**: Enhanced Apple-specific meta tags for better iOS experience
- **Service Worker Registration**: Automatic service worker registration on page load
- **Proper SEO**: Updated title and description for better discoverability
- **Accessibility**: Added lang attribute to HTML tag

### 4. Offline Fallback Page (`web/offline.html`)
- **Custom Offline Experience**: Beautiful branded offline page
- **Consistent Styling**: Matches app's mystical theme with gradient background
- **User-Friendly**: Clear message with retry button
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on all device sizes

## Testing PWA Features

### Local Testing
1. Build the Flutter web app:
   ```bash
   flutter build web
   ```

2. Serve the built app locally:
   ```bash
   cd build/web
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

3. Open Chrome DevTools (F12) and check:
   - **Application Tab → Manifest**: Verify manifest loads correctly
   - **Application Tab → Service Workers**: Confirm service worker is registered
   - **Application Tab → Cache Storage**: Check cached resources
   - **Lighthouse Tab**: Run PWA audit (should score high)

### PWA Installation Testing
1. Visit the app in Chrome/Edge
2. Look for install prompt in the address bar
3. Click to install as standalone app
4. Verify app launches in standalone window

### Offline Testing
1. With app loaded, open DevTools
2. Go to Network tab
3. Select "Offline" throttling
4. Reload page - should work from cache
5. Navigate away and return - should show offline.html if needed

### iOS Testing
1. Open app in Safari on iOS
2. Tap Share → Add to Home Screen
3. Verify icon and name appear correctly
4. Launch from home screen - should open without Safari UI

## Browser Compatibility

### Full PWA Support:
- Chrome/Chromium 67+
- Edge 79+
- Samsung Internet 8+
- Firefox 79+ (with some limitations)
- Safari 11.3+ (iOS) - limited features

### Features by Browser:
| Feature | Chrome | Edge | Safari | Firefox |
|---------|--------|------|--------|---------|
| Service Worker | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Web Manifest | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| Install Prompt | ✅ | ✅ | ✅* | ❌ |
| Offline Support | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Push Notifications | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |

*Safari uses "Add to Home Screen" instead of install prompt

## Deployment Considerations

### HTTPS Requirement
PWA features require HTTPS in production (except localhost for testing).

### Cache Versioning
When updating the app:
1. Increment `CACHE_NAME` in `flutter_service_worker.js`
2. Rebuild the Flutter app
3. Deploy - old caches will be automatically cleaned up

### Asset Caching
Flutter's build process generates optimized assets. The service worker caches the app shell, while Flutter handles caching of its compiled code.

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions:
1. **Push Notifications**: Notify users of daily wisdom updates
2. **Background Sync**: Sync user data when connection is restored
3. **App Shortcuts**: Quick access to favorite features
4. **Share Target**: Allow sharing content to the app
5. **Periodic Background Sync**: Fetch new content periodically
6. **Advanced Caching**: Cache JSON data files for full offline experience

### Implementation Notes:
- To cache JSON data files, add them to `RESOURCES_TO_CACHE` in service worker
- For push notifications, implement server-side push service
- Background sync requires additional service worker event listeners

## Troubleshooting

### Service Worker Not Registering
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure HTTPS is enabled (or using localhost)
- Clear browser cache and reload

### Cache Not Updating
- Increment cache version number
- Force refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Unregister old service worker in DevTools

### Icons Not Showing
- Verify icon files exist in `web/icons/`
- Check manifest.json paths are correct
- Ensure icons meet PWA size requirements (192px, 512px)
