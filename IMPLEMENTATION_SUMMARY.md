  5. Run `flutter analyze`
  6. Run `flutter test`
  7. Check for warnings in analysis output
- Ensures CI completes without errors or warnings

**Files Created:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

## Summary

All 7 tasks have been successfully completed:

- `assets/data/schema.md`
- `assets/fonts/PlayfairDisplay.ttf`

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the implementation:

1. **Fonts**: Run the app offline and verify fonts render correctly
2. **Onboarding**: Clear app data and launch to see onboarding flow
3. **CI**: Push changes and verify GitHub Actions workflow runs successfully
4. **Documentation**: Review README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and schema.md for clarity

## Notes

- Screenshot placeholders are in `docs/` directory - actual screenshots should be added when the app is running
- The CI workflow requires a Flutter environment in GitHub Actions (configured in the workflow)
- Fonts are variable fonts supporting multiple weights, which is more efficient than static fonts
- Onboarding can be reset by clearing app data or SharedPreferences
