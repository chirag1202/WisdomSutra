# Wisdom Sutra (UI Scaffold)

Early Flutter UI-only scaffold reflecting deep indigo + gold + parchment mystical theme.

## Tech
Flutter, Provider, shared_preferences, Google Fonts.

## Run
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Fonts
Using GoogleFonts (Playfair Display + Noto Sans Gujarati). To bundle locally, download the OFL font files into `assets/fonts/` and uncomment the fonts section in `pubspec.yaml`.

## Data
Static JSON under `assets/data/` maps 4-slot parity patterns (odd=1, even=2) to sample answers. Expand as needed.

## Next Steps
- Add real font files & refine typographic scale.
- Expand answer dataset & pattern logic.
- Implement sharing & export of answer cards.
- Add onboarding & accessibility adjustments.
